Uesful trick to see the logs in a separate file.

Edit (Create) /etc/rsyslog/rsyslog.d/10-custom.conf
with the following contents:

if $programname == 'HSEncFs' then {
        /var/log/hsencfs.log
        ~
}

Then the file '/var/log/hsencfs.log' contains details of
the hsencfs workings. Use the -l option to control how much detail
would you like to see;

To copy every file including hidden ones (starting with a dot) use:

shopt -s dotglob

Assuming the following setup:

~/secrets       for the encrypted (user visible) directory
~/.secrets      for the supporting (data/storage) directory

One can copy plain files out:

1.) mount directory with hsencfs
2.) copy as usual

   example:  hsencfs ~/secret

One can copy encrypted files out:

1.) the directory does not have to be bounted
2.) enable copying all files; use: shopt -s dotglob
2.) copy as usual

   example:  cp -a  ~/.secret/*  target_dir


Announcements / History

Tue 06.Jul.2021     dummy encryption is intercepted correctly
Tue 12.Apr.2022     started virtual based encryption

Older Announcements:

     The source code copied out to the ecrypted directory does NOT compile in that
    directory correctly.

    This means the file access intercept is not random clean,
    as GCC acesses object files by chunk.

     The trick was to pre read to the encryption buffer boundary, and then
      Decrypt / Patch / Encrypt / Write.

     The last buffer may be partial, so special arragements are made to
    accomodate that.
