Uesful trick to see the logs in a separate file.

Edit (Create) /etc/rsyslog/rsyslog.d/10-custom.conf
with the following contents:

if $programname == 'HSENCFS' then {
        /var/log/hsencfs.log
        ~
}

To copy every file including hidden ones (starting with a dot) use:

shopt -s dotglob


Assuming the following setup:

~/secrets       for the encrypted directory
~/.secrets      for the supporting data directory

One can copy plain files out:

1.) mount directory with hsencfs
2.) copy as usual

   example:  hsencfs ~/secret

One can copy encrypted files out:

1.) the directory does not have to be bounted
2.) enable copying all files; use: shopt -s dotglob
2.) copy as usual

   example:  cp -a  ~/.secret/*  target_dir


Announcement

 The source code copied out to the ecrypted directory does NOT compile in that
directory correctly.

This means the file access intercept is not random clean,
as GCC acesses object files by chunk.

 The trick was to pre read to the encryption buffer boundary, and then
  Decrypt / Patch / Encrypt / Write.

 The last buffer may be partial, so special arragements are made to
accomodate that.
