 This directory contains the encrypting / decrypting tools that can handle an
individual file. Please note, that no key management is done, the utilities
will blindly obey your command to encrypt / decrypt any file. These utilities
are entended as a rescue / testing tool. Entering the wrong password will
generate false cyphertext, entering the wrong password on decryption will
generate false clear text.

     !!! It is your responsibility to use this collection as intended. !!!

 Files can be extracted from the backing data directory with the 'bpdec2'
utility. To extract a single encrypted file by hand:

     bpdec2 ~/secretdata/filename > newname

(Will ask for password.)

Files can be copied to the backing data directory with the 'bpenc2' utility.
To add a single file into the data directory by hand:

     bpdec2 filename > ~/.secretdata/newname

(Will ask for password.)
