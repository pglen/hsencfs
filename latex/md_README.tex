Tue 06.\+Jul.\+2021 dummy encryption intercepted, working OK

HSENCFS is a user space encrypting file system. Simple to set up, seamless to use, fast, safe, secure and maintenance free. It will encrypt data on the fly written to it, decrypt data read from it. HSENCFS uses only storage space for actual data stored, no pre-\/allocation needed. It is fast enough for real time Video Encryption. HSENCFS is classified as a variable key length encryption.

An additional (and useful) feature is auditing. HSENCFS reports file access by time and user ID. The report is sent to syslog. The log is sent to facility \textquotesingle{}daemon\textquotesingle{} with level \textquotesingle{}DEBUG\textquotesingle{}. See\+: the -\/l log option.)

To use it (as a simple example)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} hsencfs  ~/secrets
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Will ask for password, and password creation confirmation if started on a new mount. The above command exposes the $\sim$/secrets directory with the backing data directory in $\sim$/.secrets

For added convenience, one may specify a dotted (hidden) file for mountdata. \begin{DoxyVerb}  hsencfs  ~/secrets ~/.secrets
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (in this example the storage dir becomes\+: $\sim$/.secrets (note the leading dot)

You may un-\/mount your secret directory with the normal umount(8) utility or the fusermount -\/u option. After un-\/mounting, the mounted data is not accessible, and the encrypted data is not legible until it is mounted again.

(example\+: fusermount $\sim$/secrets) The tilde \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{} expands to the user\textquotesingle{}s home dir.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Password / Key management.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
HSENCFS does not manage passwords. The password becomes the encryption key, and the key is used to encrypt the file system access. If the password / key is lost, the data cannot be recovered. Seriously, the data is lost.

As the password becomes the key, it is possible to achieve long key lengths by entering a long password. Short key lengths are replicated to standard legal length.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{On Demand Password entry\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
HSENCFS mount can be mounted (started) with the on-\/demand (-\/o) password option. This allows the encryption to ask for a password when any encrypted file is first accessed.

The on-\/demand option requires the use of an ask-\/pass program. The \mbox{\hyperlink{hsaskpass_8py}{hsaskpass.\+py}} is supplied for GUI deployment. HSENCFS will start the ask-\/pass program when a password is needed. This only truly makes sense on GUI deployment, but the console program (hsaskpass) can also be specified.

An example of on-\/demand command line\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    hsencfs -o -a 'which hsaskpass.py` .mydata mysecret
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note the \textquotesingle{}which\textquotesingle{} utility, as HSENCFS needs absolute path. In real deployment, specify the askpass program\textquotesingle{}s absolute path.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Safety, Security, Feeding and Care}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
HSENCFS uses Blue\+Point2 encryption. Bluepoint(2) has been thoroughly evaluated, and withstood the test of time. The backing files in the data directory preserve their original names, size, and access times. The only dependence they need is the original password. This means they can be safely copied from the backing directory for transport. (like email or backup) Please note that HSENCFS having block size 4096, and will handle data accordingly.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{The data directory\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
Files can be extracted from the backing data directory with the \textquotesingle{}bpdec2\textquotesingle{} utility. To extract a single encrypted file by hand\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} bpdec2 ~/.secrets/filename  newname
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (Will ask for password.)

Also, files can be copied to the backing data directory with the \textquotesingle{}bpenc2\textquotesingle{} utility. To add a single file into the data directory by hand\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} bpdec2 filename > ~/.secretdata/newname
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (Will ask for password.)

Both bp(enc/dec) utilities need the correct password to create data accessible from the HSENCFS subsystem. The utilities do not check the encryption key, so the wrong password will produce false cipher-\/text / false clear-\/text. You may reverse false encryption by entering the same password on decrypt. These utilities are provided as recovery tools only. The wrong password may create garbled data. $\ast$$\ast$ You have been warned. $\ast$$\ast$\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{The cypher text.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
Files can be copied out from the backing data directory. They stay encrypted when copied directly out of the backing/data directory. This is useful for backup / replication / archiving / transport etc ... make sure you copy them with hidden (.dot) files included. Use\+: shopt -\/s dotglob before copy. Warning\+: the copied data will be unreadable without the dot files.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Going to the Cloud.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
The backing data directory can reside on any valid file system, including a cloud drive. HSENCFS will encrypt data automatically before the data sees the transport layer, and decrypt data after the transport layer delivered it.

This allows secure remote storage without data ever leaving the local context without encryption.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{The Mountpoint directory\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
When the mountpoint is mounted, data is encrypted / decrypted on the fly. HSENCFS will warn you if the mount directory is not empty on mount. It is usually undesirable to mount over data. You may force the mount, see FUSE options for details.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Configuring Shared Mountpoint(s)\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
By default FUSE will not allow anyone (except the user) to see the mount. To create a mount that is visible by others (on the same system) use the fuse \textquotesingle{}allow\+\_\+other\textquotesingle{} option. To append FUSE options, use \textquotesingle{}--\textquotesingle{} at the end of HSENCFS command line. Fuse will not allow the allow\+\_\+other option unless configured in /etc/fuse.conf (add a line\+: \textquotesingle{}user\+\_\+allow\+\_\+other\textquotesingle{})

Example\+: hsencfs .mydata mymount -- -\/o allow\+\_\+other\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{Technical Description\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}
HSENCFS makes use of the API offered by the fuse subsystem to intercept file operations. The interception is done from mountdata to mountpoint. Copying data to the mountpoint directory ends up encrypted in mountdata. Because of HSENCFS intercept concept, encryption / decryption is fast. It is plausible (and tested) to use it to encrypt video streams, or compile programs in the encrypted directory.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{The GNOME Panel Applet\+: (unsupported)}\label{md_README_autotoc_md11}
HSENCFS can be controlled from the GNOME Panel (System Tray) with the \mbox{\hyperlink{hstray_8py}{hstray.\+py}} utility. New mounts can be added, mounted or unmounted. The mounts are relative to the user\textquotesingle{}s home directory unless an absolute path is specified.

The \textquotesingle{}comments\textquotesingle{} field can be used as a password hint. See PASSHINTS.

Removing mounts from the hstray\textquotesingle{}s list does not effect the data behind it. The mounts created from the system tray are visible from the command line, but the mounts created on the command line are not visible in the system tray. (added protection)

Upon panel install, the System Panel needs to rescan for the list of Applets for the HSENCFS applet to show up. This can be achieved by adding an arbitrary Applet to the panel, and then removing it. After the panel add / remove cycle, the HSENCFS applet will show up. Naturally, one can force a rescan by restarting the gnome-\/panel or X-\/windows or the whole system.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Additional Versions\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md12}
