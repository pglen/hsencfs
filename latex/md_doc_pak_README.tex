\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{The High Security encrypting File System.}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md1}
HSENCFS is a user space encrypting file system. Simple to set up, seamless to use, fast, safe, secure and maintenance free. It will encrypt data on the fly written to it, decrypt data read from it.

HSENCFS uses only storage space for actual data stored, no pre-\/allocation needed. It is fast enough for real time Video Encryption. HSENCFS is classified as a variable key length encryption.

An additional (and useful) feature is auditing. HSENCFS reports file access by time and user ID. The report is sent to syslog. The log is sent to facility \textquotesingle{}daemon\textquotesingle{} with level \textquotesingle{}DEBUG\textquotesingle{}. See\+: the -\/l log option.)

To use it (as a simple example)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb} hsencfs  ~/secrets
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Will ask for password, and password creation confirmation if started on a new mount. The above command exposes the $\sim$/secrets directory with the backing data directory in $\sim$/.secrets

For added convenience, one may specify a dotted (hidden) file for mount data. \begin{DoxyVerb}  hsencfs  ~/secrets ~/.secrets
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (in both examples the storage dir becomes\+: $\sim$/.secrets (note the leading dot)

You may un-\/mount your secret directory with the normal umount(8) utility or the fusermount -\/u option. After un-\/mounting, the mounted data is not accessible, and the encrypted data is not legible until it is mounted again.

(example\+: fusermount -\/u $\sim$/secrets) The tilde \textquotesingle{}$\sim$\textquotesingle{} expands to the user\textquotesingle{}s home dir.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Password / Key management.}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md2}
HSENCFS does not manage passwords. The password becomes the encryption key, and the key is used to encrypt the file system access. If the password / key is lost, the data cannot be recovered. Seriously, the data is lost.

As the password becomes the key, it is possible to achieve long key lengths by entering a long password. Short key lengths are replicated to standard legal length.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{On Demand Password entry\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md3}
HSENCFS mount can be mounted (started) with the on-\/demand (-\/o) password option. This allows the encryption to ask for a password when any encrypted file is first accessed or listed.

The on-\/demand option requires the use of an ask-\/pass program. The hsaskpass.\+py is supplied for GUI deployment. HSENCFS will start the ask-\/pass program when a password is needed. This only truly makes sense on GUI deployment, but the console program (hsaskpass) can also be specified.

An example of on-\/demand command line\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    hsencfs -o -a `which hsaskpass.py` mysecretdir .mysecretdir
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note the backticks and the \textquotesingle{}which\textquotesingle{} utility, as HSENCFS needs the absolute path of the askpass program. In real deployment, specify the askpass program\textquotesingle{}s absolute path. The askpass program delivers the base64 encoded version of the pass.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Safety, Security}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md4}
HSENCFS uses Blue\+Point2 encryption. Bluepoint(2) has been thoroughly evaluated, and withstood the test of time. The backing files in the data directory preserve their original names, size, and access times. The only dependence they need is the original password, and the .datx file. The files can be safely copied from the backing directory for transport to other locations. (for instance backup)\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Feeding and Care}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md5}
Please note that HSENCFS block size is 4096, and will handle data accordingly. This was by choice, so encryption can be exceptionally strong.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{The data directory\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md6}
Files can be extracted from the backing data directory. Just mount it, and copy the files as usual.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{The cypher text.}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md7}
Files can be copied out from the backing data directory. They stay encrypted when copied directly out of the backing/data directory. This is useful for backup / replication / archiving / transport etc ... make sure you copy them with hidden (.nnn.\+datx) files included. Use\+: shopt -\/s dotglob before copy. Warning\+: the copied data will be unlegible without the dot files.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Going to the Cloud.}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md8}
The backing data directory can reside on any valid file system, including a cloud drive. HSENCFS will encrypt data automatically before the data sees the transport layer, and decrypt data after the transport layer delivered it. This makes hsencfs an end to end cipher, which allows secure remote storage without data ever leaving the local context without encryption.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{The Mount Point directory\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md9}
When the mountpoint is mounted, data is encrypted / decrypted on the fly. HSENCFS will warn you if the mount directory is not empty on mount. It is usually undesirable to mount over data. You may force the mount, see FUSE options for details.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Configuring Shared Mountpoint(s)\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md10}
By default FUSE will not allow anyone (except the user) to see the mount. To create a mount that is visible by others (on the same system) use the fuse \textquotesingle{}allow\+\_\+other\textquotesingle{} option. To append FUSE options, use \textquotesingle{}--\textquotesingle{} at the end of HSENCFS command line. Fuse will not allow the allow\+\_\+other option unless configured in /etc/fuse.conf (add a line\+: \textquotesingle{}user\+\_\+allow\+\_\+other\textquotesingle{})

Example\+: hsencfs mymount -- -\/o allow\+\_\+other\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Technical Description\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md11}
HSENCFS makes use of the API offered by the fuse subsystem to intercept file operations. The interception is done from mountdata to mountpoint. Placing data to the mountpoint directory ends up encrypted in mountdata. Because of HSENCFS intercept concept, encryption / decryption is fast. It is plausible (and tested) to use it to encrypt video streams, or compile programs in the encrypted directory.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Technical Details\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md12}
HSENCFS disallows links. (for now) It may create a complex web of interceptions as one may link out of directory, essentially linking to an unencrypted file. Note, that this is not a serious shortcoming as most programs can deal with this. For instance, the source code of the project compiles flawlessly in an encrypted directory. Please note that the files inside the encrypted directory can be linked to.

HSENCFS does not interpret locks. This decision was made after using libreoffice in the encrypted directory. Again not a serious drawback, as the office suites have their own locking mechanism.

HSENCFS does not support secret mount in a mount. This may be due to how fuse operates.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{The GNOME Panel Applet\+: (unsupported)}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md13}
HSENCFS can be controlled from the GNOME Panel (System Tray) with the hstray.\+py utility. New mounts can be added, mounted or unmounted. The mounts are relative to the user\textquotesingle{}s home directory unless an absolute path is specified.

The \textquotesingle{}comments\textquotesingle{} field can be used as a password hint. See PASSHINTS.

Removing mounts from the hstray\textquotesingle{}s list does not effect the data behind it. The mounts created from the system tray are visible from the command line, but the mounts created on the command line are not visible in the system tray. (added protection)

Upon panel install, the System Panel needs to rescan for the list of Applets for the HSENCFS applet to show up. This can be achieved by adding an arbitrary Applet to the panel, and then removing it. After the panel add / remove cycle, the HSENCFS applet will show up. Naturally, one can force a rescan by restarting the gnome-\/panel or X-\/windows or the whole system.\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{Additional Versions\+:}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md14}
The industrial version of this project is available upon request. Please send a message to the author. (see github page)\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{Configuring syslog}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md15}
Useful trick to see the logs in a separate file. Edit (Create) /etc/rsyslog/rsyslog.d/10-\/custom.\+conf

with the following contents\+:

if \$programname == \textquotesingle{}HSEnc\+Fs\textquotesingle{} then \{ /var/log/hsencfs.log $\sim$ \}

Then the file \textquotesingle{}/var/log/hsencfs.log\textquotesingle{} contains details of the hsencfs workings. Use the -\/l option to control how much detail would you like to see; 0=none ... 3=some ... 9=all\hypertarget{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysection{Backup and recovery}\label{md_doc_pak_README_autotoc_md16}
To copy every file including hidden ones (starting with a dot) use\+:

shopt -\/s dotglob

Assuming the following setup\+:

$\sim$/secrets for the encrypted (user visible) directory $\sim$/.secrets for the supporting (data/storage) directory

One can copy plain files out\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    1.) mount directory with hsencfs
    2.) copy as usual

    example:     hsencfs ~/secrets ~/.secrets
                 cp -a ~/secrets/* /where_the_backup_goes
\end{DoxyVerb}
 One can copy encrypted files out\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    1.) the directory does not have to be mounted
    2.) enable copying all files; use: shopt -s dotglob
    2.) copy as usual

    example:     shopt -s dotglob    # all files, including dot files
                 cp -a  ~/.secret/*  "where_the_encrypted_backup_goes"
                 shopt -u dotglob    # restore flag, no dot files any more
\end{DoxyVerb}
