  These are various test routines to read / write files in a manner that simulates
real life access.

 |    File         |        Short Description
 | ------------    | -------------------------- |
 | dualwrite.c     |        write in two chunks
 | hello.c         |        just saying hello
 | seekcp.c        |        copy and seek and copy
 | zigjump.c       |        copy seek in arbitrary order
 | zigzag.c        |        copy seek in arbitrary order, zig and zag
 | farwrite.c      |        seek past EOF, write some more



// EOF
