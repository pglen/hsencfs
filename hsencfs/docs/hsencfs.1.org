.SH NAME
hsencfs \- High Security Encrypting File System
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsencfs
[
.I options 
]  dataroot mountpoint
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B HSENCFS 
is a user space encrypting file system. It is simple to set up,
seamless to use, fast, safe, secure and maintenance free.  It will
automatically encrypt data written to it, decrypt data read from it. It
only uses storage space for actual data stored, no pre-allocation
needed. It is fast enough for real time video encryption. HSENCFS is
classified as a variable key length encryption.

   An additional and useful feature is auditing. HSENCFS reports file
access by time and user ID. The report is sent to syslog. The log is
sent to facility 'daemon' with level 'DEBUG'. See: the -l log option.)

.SH OPTIONS
    -l num      - Use log level  (-loglevel)
    -p pass     - Use pass (!!Warning!! clear text pass) (-pass)
    -a program  - Use program for asking pass (-askpass)
    -o          - On demand pass. Ask on first access (-ondemand)
    -f          - Force creation of storagedir/mountpoint (-force)
    -q          - Quiet (-quiet)
    -v          - Verbose (-verbose)
    -V          - Print version (-version)
    
See the info page for more details.

.SH The System Tray / GNOME Panel

.b Controlling HSENCFS

HSENCFS can be controlled from the GNOME Panel / System Tray with the hstray.py utility. 
New mounts can be added, mounted or unmounted. The mounts are
relative to the user's home directory unless absolute path is specified. Deleting 
mounts from the hstray's list does not effect the data behind it.
The mounts created from the system tray are visible from the command line,
but the mounts created on the command line are not visible in the system
tray. (added protection)

.SH Encryption / Decryption Utilites

Files can be extracted from the backing data directory with the 'bpdec2' 
utility. To extract a single encrypted file by hand:

     bpdec2 ~/secretdata/filename > newname
     
(Will ask for password.)

Also, files can be copied to the backing data directory with 
the 'bpenc2' utility. To add a single file into the data directory by hand:

     bpdec2 filename > ~/.secretdata/newname
     
(Will ask for password.)

Both utilities need the correct password to be accessible from the HSENCFS realm.
Entering the wrong pass will produce false cypher text or decrypt to garbage.
!You have been warned! These utilities are supplied as recovery tools only.
